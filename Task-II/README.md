# Task II: Classical Graph Neural Network (GNN)

For Task II, you will use ParticleNetâ€™s data for Quark/Gluon jet classification available here with its corresponding description.

- Choose 2 Graph-based architectures of your choice to classify jets as being quarks or gluons. Provide a description on what considerations you have taken to project this point-cloud dataset to a set of interconnected nodes and edges.

- Discuss the resulting performance of the 2 chosen architectures.

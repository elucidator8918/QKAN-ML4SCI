# Task I: Quantum Computing Part

1. Implement a simple quantum operation with Cirq or Pennylane:
    - With 5 qubits
    - Apply Hadamard operation on every qubit
    - Apply CNOT operation on (0, 1), (1,2), (2,3), (3,4)
    - SWAP (0, 4)
    - Rotate X with pi/2 on any qubit
    - Plot the circuit
    

2. Implement a second circuit with a framework of your choice:
    - Apply a Hadmard gate to the first qubit
    - Rotate the second qubit by pi/3 around X
    - Apply Hadamard gate to the third and fourth qubit
    - Perform a swap test between the states of the first and second qubit
     $ \ket {q1q2} $ and the third and fourth qubit $ \ket {q3q4} $
